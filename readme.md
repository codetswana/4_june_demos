# 4 June 2014

In this meeting, Razzi and Alec presented [learning resources](http://www.codetswana.com/resources) and talked about what they do as developers.

Razzi also presented [a small json endpoint as an example of a backend](backend_example.py) and used Twilio and Python to call everybody's phones and play music.

_In order to make Twilio calls, you must sign up, add your account SID and auth token, and buy a phone number (Razzi got his from South Africa for $1 / month)._
